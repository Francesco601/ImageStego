# ImageStego

 Steganography is the practice of concealing sensitive information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. It can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video, or audio content. That hidden data is then extracted at its destination. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image or video. 

Python has some interesting tools to carry out and implement steganography. This program 
does not rely on any of these resources but uses a different approach. The key libraries/modules used are Tkinter, which is the standard interface in Python for creating a GUI (graphical user interface). The PIL modules which is the images module from Pillow. The PIL helps to open, manipulate and save many different forms of images. ImageTK is used to create and modify Tkinter photoimages from PIL images. The OS modules is used for creating and removing any directory.

To run the program, ensure that you have Tkinter and the other modules installed, which can usually be done through the command $ pip install. 

Finally, run 

```bash
  python imagestego.py  
 ```
